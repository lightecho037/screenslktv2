## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightecho037/screenslktv2.git
cd screenslktv2
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

The application will minimize to the system tray. Look for the screen capture icon in your system tray.

### Capturing Screen

**Method 1: Global Hotkey**
- Press `ALT+F2` anywhere on your system to start capturing

**Method 2: System Tray**
- Right-click the tray icon
- Select "Capture Screen (ALT+F2)"

### Selecting Region

1. After triggering capture, your screen will darken
2. Click and drag to select the region you want to capture
3. Release the mouse to confirm selection
4. Press `ESC` to cancel

### Annotating

Once you've captured a region, the annotation window appears with these tools:

- **✏️ Pen**: Draw freehand lines and shapes
- **📝 Text**: Click to add text annotations
- **➡️ Arrow**: Draw arrows to point at specific areas
- **⬜ Rectangle**: Draw rectangle shapes
- **⭕ Ellipse**: Draw ellipse/circle shapes

**Additional Controls**:
- **🎨 Color**: Click to choose annotation color
- **Width**: Adjust the pen width (1-20 pixels)
- **💾 Save**: Save the annotated image to a file
- **📋 Copy**: Copy the image to clipboard
- **❌ Close**: Close the annotation window

### Moving the Window

Click and drag the toolbar area (top dark bar) to move the annotation window anywhere on your screen.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Windows OS (tested on Windows 10/11)
- PyQt5
- Additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Dependencies

- **PyQt5**: GUI framework
- **Pillow**: Image processing
- **keyboard**: Global hotkey support
- **pywin32**: Windows-specific functionality (Windows only)

## Architecture

The application is organized into clean, modular classes:

- **`main.py`**: Application entry point
- **`screen_capture.py`**: 
  - `ScreenCaptureApp`: Main application and tray icon management
  - `SelectionOverlay`: Screen region selection interface
- **`annotation_window.py`**:
  - `AnnotationWindow`: Annotation interface and tool management
  - `AnnotationTool`: Tool definitions

## Troubleshooting

### Screen Capture Not Working

If pressing ALT+F2 doesn't show the capture overlay:

1. **Check the console output**: Run the application from command line using `python main.py` to see log messages
   - You should see "ALT+F2 pressed - starting capture..." when you press the hotkey
   - You should see "Screenshot captured successfully: WxH" when capture succeeds
   - If you see error messages, they will indicate which capture method failed

2. **Enable debug logging** (optional): To see detailed debug information, set the logging level to DEBUG:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```
   Then run `python main.py`

3. **Verify the hotkey is registered**: Look for "ALT+F2 hotkey registered successfully" message on startup

4. **Try running as administrator**: On Windows, some applications may need elevated privileges to register global hotkeys

5. **Use the tray icon as alternative**: Right-click the tray icon and select "Capture Screen (ALT+F2)"

### Hotkey Not Working

If ALT+F2 hotkey doesn't work:
- The application may not have sufficient permissions
- Try running as administrator
- Use the tray icon menu as an alternative

### Application Not Appearing in Tray

- Check if your system tray is set to show all icons
- Look in the hidden icons area (click the up arrow in system tray)
